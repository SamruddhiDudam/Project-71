                        Catholic-Christian religious order founded by St. Ignatius of Loyola in 1540. The school is recognised by the Directorate of

                <div class="line float-container row">
                    <div class="column float-child">At the beginning (1960) the school used the grounds and buildings of Hotel Cecil, well known in the
                        British Raj era, purchased for that purpose.[2] The luxury hotel, situated on Rajniwas Marg in the Civil Lines area of Delhi[3] in an 11-
                        acre (45,000 m2) park, had over a hundred rooms, large lawns, and a swimming pool. The Patna Province of the Society of Jesus
                        bought it (including the premises and the services of the hotel employees) from the siblings Mr. Edwin Hotz and Mrs. Pauline White,
                        who were of Swiss/English extraction, and was granted permission by the Commissioner of Delhi to convert it into a residential
                        school for boys.

                        St. Xavier's School was inaugurated on 6 January 1960 by the Archbishop His Excellency James Knox, the representative of the
                        Vatican in India, under the stewardship of Jesuit Fr. Frank Loesch, the first Rector.[2] Loesh went on to buy the adjacent land from
                        the Gujarati Samaj and further on the Bombay House, for later expansion. In the following week admissions for new classes began,
                        starting with Std. V and reaching down to Prep. At the end of the week there were, remarkably, over 700 boys enrolled. It was
                        granted recognition by the Directorate of Education within a month of its inception.

                        Fr. Charles Saldhana, born 13 Jan 1892, attended St. Xavier's college, Bombay. He began his Jesuit career as a professor of
                        mathematics in Pune and Dharwar. He then became the first principal of St. Xavier's College, Ranchi, and from 1951-1952 the first
                        principal of Nirmala College, Delhi University, the present Kirori Mal College. In 1959, at the age of 67, Fr. Charles was asked to be
                        first principal of St. Xavier's in Delhi, his "Benjamin" as he remarked, the child of his old age. He fell ill on the day the school was
                        inaugurated, but remained principal until July. Then he was appointed the headmaster of the prep department and supervised the
                        math program for the entire school. He worked with Frs. Loesch, Rodrigues, and Austin Reinboth in converting the hotel campus into
                        a modern public school. </div>
                    <div class="column float-child">After 14 years in Delhi he returned to Patna and remained active in the Jesuit community. In the fall of
                        1978 he returned to Delhi for his retreat and died on 27 November 1978. He mortal remains are buried in Delhi.
                        The prep classes were held in Bombay House while the five buildings of the hotel accommodated some classrooms and dorms with
                        four to five boys in a room which had the unusual facility of a dressing area and attached toilets. Parts of the residential quarters
                        were renovated to accommodate the staff.

                        At the same time work was begun on the five-storied school buildings. Many of the old buildings were destroyed but some were
                        retained and remain in use, like the Fathers' residence, chapel, hall, Snob's Row, and the swimming pool. Modern classrooms,
                        teacher's tutorial rooms, science laboratories, a library, and a host of other facilities were constructed and a large playing field
                        created by leveling the ground occupied by a road that had cut across the area. By 1965, the Junior and the Senior school buildings
                        were ready and occupied, and Fr. Thomas Kunnunkal took over from Fr. Thomas Athazhapadam. Fr. Kunnunkal, who was later
                        awarded Padma Shri, was responsible for much of the pattern the school adopted in later years. Hostel and boarding facilities were
                        discontinued in December 1971 and the hostel building was converted into a Jesuit house of formation.

                        In the 1980s St. Xavier's switched from English to Hindi as the medium of instruction in junior classes. This measure (along with the
                        decision to set apart 25% of seats for the poor – with subsidized uniform/books/tuition) was a part of changing the image of the
                        school from one of "school for affluents" to one of "school for local needs". A large number of parents pulled their children out of
                        school and many teachers left. The school continued its policy of teaching in Hindi in the belief that younger children learn best in
                        their mother tongue.

                        In 1985, the school admitted girls, starting from prep grade, and is now fully co-educational.

                        In 2007, St Xavier's again switched from Hindi to English as the medium of instruction in junior classes.

                        The inscription at the bottom proclaims that St. Xavier's school was founded in 1960 and is located in Delhi. Esto Vir (Latin for "Be a

                        show yourself a man (Esto Vir) and keep the charge of the Lord, your God walking in His ways and keeping His statutes and
                        commandments so that you may prosper in all you do." Later the meaning of Esto Vir was changed to "Be human".</div>

                        <p class="tttitle">The college stage and auditorium that you see today, has come through a historic process of evolution and gradual
                            transformation. The earliest roots of this stage goes back to the ‘Sans Soucci Theatre’, which was burned down by fire in 1843.
                            But
                            the spirit of Sans Soucci survived the holocaust, and in 1859, when the premises became the property of Belgain Jesuits, who
                            called
                            it St. Xavier’s, theatre came to life again. The St. Xavier’s stage found a place of pride in the cultural life of Calcutta.

                            The growth of the St. Xavier’s Stage and auditorium took place separately in distinct and gradual phases, creating history of its
                            own. The earliest
                            history of the college hall goes back to 1885. The Old College Hall then served as a dormitory for the boarders as well as
                            providing
                            the most convenient place for dramatic performances. After 1885, great occasions, like the Prize Distribution Day, demanded
                            more
                            space than the hall could provide. For these functions a large shamiana was erected in the open.

                            From this fledgling beginning, the St. Xavier’s stage took a giant leap into a major transformation in 1931. This change and
                            wholesome
                            transformation was solely due to the remarkable ability of Rev. Father Weaver, S. J. Still within the premises of the Old Hall, before
                            the new building was erected, Father Weaver with his vision and creative ability rebuilt the old college stage. He had the old stage
                            enlarged and renovated: new teakwood pillars and arches came into being; spotlights made the lighting scheme more effective
                            and
                            elaborate. There were set up complete sets of light in four colours, which by means of a very elaborate switch board could
                            produce
                            fairy which set off the stage magnificently. In the centre of this new stage shone the college crest in all its glory.

                            Four years later, in 1934, came the New Building, with the New Auditorium and with it, the new stage found a permanent place.
                            This New Auditorium
                            is the one which most of us have known, for it is where so many Xaverians, past and present, had always gathered. It was built
                            with
                            the same purpose in mind, as the present auditorium has been built today- to meet the needs of a growing community of
                            students.
                            In 1934 it brought St. Xavier’s pre-eminence, as a stage where some of the best plays were enacted by some of the most
                            renowned
                            theatre people. The auditorium must have filled a crying need for a proper proscenium theatre, a fairly large seating capacity and
                            despite the limited acoustics, the fairly large seating capacity and despite the limited acoustics, the opportunity for students to
                            project
                            their voices in more ways than one. It is no hyperbole to say that the voices emanating from that stage were heard not by their
                            fellow
                            collegians. Even the city of Calcutta took notice of its eloquence and repertory.
                            That hall stood for so long that even a short notice of those who incubated and took flight within it s wings will read like a long list.

                            In the bright history of the college stage are recorded names that refuse to pass out of man’s memory. With pride we may recall
                            that St. Xavier’s
                            Hall housed a very fine theatre during the war, it was called ‘The Garrison Theatre’. Professionals like Jack Hawkings, Noel
                            Coward
                            and other English and American actors performed here. In the late forties Shakespeare was brought alive performed here. In the
                            late forties
                            Shakespeare was brought alive on St. Xavier’s stage by its talented student Utpal Dutt and his newly founded theatrical company.
                            ‘The Shakespeareana’ of Geoffrey Kendal came to Calcutta and performed on the St. Xavier’s stage on more than one occasion.
                            Of
                            the many others who started their histrionic careers here were Victor Banerjee, and N. Vishwanathan.

                            Finally, no history of St. Xavier’s College stage can be complete without a reference to the late Rev. Father J. Johanns, S. J. the
                            celebrated
                            philosopher of this institution, who composed delicate, realistic and artistic religious plays which were all produced on this stage
                            almost a hundred years ago.

                            But with the century drawing to a close, in the wake of communication and technological innovations all around, the Hall gradually
                            became an
                            anachronism. The old order had to yield to the new. The heralder of this dynamic change is none other than the present principal
                            of
                            St. Xavier’s College Rev. Fr. P. C. Mathew, who saw the increasing demands for more space for the laboratories for physics and
                            the
                            need for shifting the computer centre to a more convenient location. Also the hall had to provide for greater curricular and extra
                            curricular needs. The Hall that your are seated in today, thus hides from you two important academic developments in the college.
                            The newly relocated physics laboratory right above the stage and the new computer centre right below, right where the green-
                            room
                            used to be. Yet, it does so in a manner, in a way that is best epitomized by the stunningly conceived cyclorama – just a sheet
                            tightly
                            strung across – which provides a sense of limitless space. This hall has not undergone merely cosmetic changes in the air-
                            conditioning, the large engraved doors (with the emblem of the college ), the marble floor, the paneling, the large lobbies on both
                            sides of the first floor, the paneling, the large lobbies on both sides of the first floor. There is something more – the new green-
                            room
                            and a staff library, on the first floor. With sidewalks, catwalks, world-class acoustics, state-of-the-art lighting – that would be the

                        <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Using the school canteen
                            You might like to let your child eat lunch from the school canteen once a week or fortnight, or on special occasions.

                            If your child enjoys an occasional canteen lunch, it’s a good idea to talk with your child about which canteen foods and drinks are
                            healthy and which aren’t. You can also help him choose the healthiest food on the menu.

                            Giving your child a healthy breakfast and packing a healthy lunch are the best ways to make sure your child has the energy she
                            needs to get through a busy school day. Packing your child’s lunch can also save you money.

                            Choosing healthy food from the canteen
                            Here are some healthy canteen options and ideas. If they’re available at your school canteen, these are the options to go for.

                            Sandwiches, rolls and wraps
                            Encourage your child to choose a multigrain, wholemeal or high-fibre white sandwich, roll or wrap. Healthy fillings include salad
                            and
                            lean chicken or beef, fish, eggs or lentil patties.

                            Cold food
                            Your canteen might serve fresh salads, sushi or rice paper rolls – yum!

                            Hot food
                            Here are some healthy hot food options:

                            fresh soups with wholemeal bread rolls on the side
                            pasta or lasagne with fresh tomato, bolognaise or vegetable-based sauce
                            lentil and vegetable hotpot
                            vegetable, chicken or beef curry with rice
                            rice or noodles with lean meat and vegetables.
                            Snacks
                            If your child wants to get a snack from the canteen, encourage him to choose options like these:

                            fruit salads or whole fruit
                            reduced-fat yoghurt and fruit
                            air-popped popcorn (not cooked in oil)
                            reduced-fat cheese with pita or wholemeal crackers
                            vegetable sticks with dip
                            boiled eggs
                            raisin or fruit bread.
                            It’s a good idea to pack a bottle with tap water for your child to drink and refill throughout the day. This is always healthier and
                            cheaper than buying drinks from the canteen. But if your child wants to buy a drink at the canteen, encourage her to choose water
                            or
                            reduced-fat milk and soy drinks.

                            If you have a healthy food environment at home, it helps your child learn about making better choices when eating away from
                            home.

                            Unhealthy canteen food and drinks
                            ‘Sometimes’ foods are foods with high amounts of sugar, saturated fat and salt. You see them on a lot of school canteen menus.

                            These foods aren’t healthy for your child. They give your child a short energy boost that can leave him feeling tired for the rest of
                            the
                            day. They can also lead to unhealthy weight gain if your child eats too much of them.

                            Here are sometimes foods that are best kept for lunch orders on special occasions:

                            all deep-fried foods, including chips, chicken nuggets and dim sims
                            hot pastries like sausage rolls and pies
                            cakes, slices and sweet breads like donuts
                            chocolates, lollies, chips and wedges
                            soft drinks, cordial, flavoured mineral water, sports waters, sports drinks, energy drinks, sweetened waters, flavoured milks, iced
                            tea,
                            breakfast drinks and fruit juice
                            coffee drinks – mocha, latte, cappuccino and so on – and coffee-flavoured milk drinks.
                            Vending machines at school
                            Schools sometimes use vending machines to provide food and drinks. Food stocked in vending machines is often unhealthy – for
                            example, soft drinks, lollies, chips and chocolate bars.

                            Why not send your child to school with an extra piece of fruit or some yoghurt instead? This might reduce the temptation to buy
                            snacks from the vending machine. Or you might like to look at the food in the vending machine with your child and see
                            whether there are any healthy options.

                            School canteen nutrition policy
                            Many school canteens have a nutrition policy.

                            Some schools have developed their policies based on the 2010 National Healthy School Canteens Guidelines, and others base
                            their
                            policies on their state nutrition guidelines for school canteens.

                            If you’re concerned about the nutritional quality of the food sold at your child’s tuckshop, you could ask your school about its
                            canteen
                            policy.

                            Safe foods at school canteens
                            All school canteens must follow careful food preparation procedures. Canteen providers must take proper steps to make sure
                            foods
                            are safe for children to eat.

                            Let your child know that when she buys food from the canteen, she should eat it straight away or put it in the fridge if there is one.
                            These steps help your child avoid food poisoning.</p>

                            1. Strong Scores on Standardized Tests. Of those colleges and universities that require the SAT or ACT as part of your application
                            -- and a small
                            (but growing)
                            number of schools do not -- admissions counselors seek scores that match of exceed the scores of their current students. For
                            better or worse, standardized college entrance exam scores are seen as the most objective measure of your college potential. In
                            the process of conducting your
                            research on colleges, you should easily be able to find a profile of the most recently admitted class. (Note: colleges that do not
                            require a
                            standardized test for admission consideration do usually require supplemental materials, such as a graded paper from a core
                            academic course and a portfolio that showcases your strengths, interests, and achievements.)

                            2. High Grade Point Average. It goes without question that grades are an extremely important element of your college application.
                            Colleges will ask you to submit official transcripts from your high school and possibly recalculate your grade point
                            average based on some internal system they use for weighting
                            different types of courses. Your goal, from the first year of high school forward, is to achieve the best grades you can. If you had a
                            rough freshman
                            year, but have since rebounded with much stronger grades, fear not, because colleges certainly look for trends in academic
                            achievement -- and a record of constant improvement when your GPA is not as strong as you would like is a good sign to most
                            admissions counselors about your growth and potential.


                            3. Challenging College-Prep Courses. Your challenge is not just to get the best grades you can -- but to get the best grades you can
                            in the most academically challenging courses as you can. You certainly do not need to enroll in an International
                            Baccalaureate (IB) Program at your high school, but where you have the strengths, skills, and aptitude, you should at

                            least strive for Honors or Advanced Placement (AP) courses. Most colleges will place greater weight on these "tougher" courses -- and even go so
                            far as to rate a B in an advanced class (IB, Honors, AP) on a higher scale than an A in a
                            comparable mainstream class.

                            4. Top Percentage of Class Standing. Class rank and class standing are moving a little further to the back of the pack, partly
                            because class rank means almost nothing in high schools that are at the extremes -- horrible or exceptional. In some of the top high
                            school programs, class rank has been found to actually hurt some of the very best students -- because only so many can be in the
                            top 1, 5, or even 10 percent of the class. Grades obviously drive class rank, so you should of course strive for the very best grades --
                            and then just hope that the ranking works in your favor or that the colleges you apply to don't use rank as a top criteria for
                            admissions.

                            5. Leadership Positions in a Few Organizations. Most colleges and universities are seeking leaders from within their applicant
                            pool,
                            and you can make your application stand out by having one or two leadership positions over the course of your high school
                            career.
                            Being a leader in one or two organizations means much, much more than simply being a member in 10 clubs and organizations.
                            Not
                            only does leadership show a certain level of maturity and character, but colleges also have an eye to all their student
                            organizations
                            and their need to recruit future leaders. You don't need to be the president of an organization, but you should be an officer of at
                            least
                            one group by the time you're a senior.


                            6. Active Involvement in Community Service. There's no requirement for community service to gain admittance to college, but just
                            about all college-bound high school students have jumped on the bandwagon, volunteering throughout the local community. It
                            seems to be one of these unwritten rules that applicants who volunteer many, many hours in the service of supporting others will
                            become a key campus activist. Regardless of the importance for admission to college, most experts agree on the value and self-
                            fulfillment people get in helping others.

                            7. Insightful and Well-Written Essay(s). Of all the 10 items on this list, the essay either gets the most attention or the least respect --
                            depending on who you ask. Like some of the other 10 elements on this list, not all colleges require an essay as part of the
                            admissions application. The essay -- or essays -- are a tool used by some universities to learn more about you and why you want to
                            attend their school. Definitely take the time to carefully consider the questions and write, edit, rewrite, and proofread your essays --
                            with an eye to what the essays reveal about you and your personality. Some admissions counselors admit that an amazing essay
                            can push a marginal applicant into the accepted student group. Learn more about college essay writing in our article, Writing the
                            Successful College Application Essay.

                            8. Quality Recommendations from Teachers and Guidance Counselor. The recommendation letters that you ask your teachers and
                            your guidance counselor to write can play a key role in your college application. Ideally, you have a few favorite teachers -- teachers
                            who not only know the quality of your work and academic acumen, but also can talk about some of your personal qualities. It's best
                            to ask your teachers for letters as early as you can so that they have the time to write a quality letter; obviously the most popular
                            teachers will need even more time if they have requests from many of their students.

                            9. Relevant Recommendations from Professionals and Others. One other nice touch -- especially for a college you really want to
                            attend -- is to ask a professional such as a former (or current) boss to write a letter of recommendation for you. Even better if that
                            person has some sort of tie to the college as a donor or alumnus. Other possibilities include your supervisor from one or more of
                            your volunteering/community service projects or a coach from one of the teams you have played for. If you have run your own
                            business, you might ask a favorite customer to write a letter. Finally, you can also ask a family friend or religious leader to write a
                            letter -- but personal references are not as strong as academic or professional ones.

                            10. Work and Entrepreneurial Experiences. While you certainly do not need to have ever held a part-time or summer job or
                            started
                            your own business, if you have some unique experiences, writing about your experiences can be a great essay topic as well as
                            showcasing your professionalism and time-management skills. College admissions folks love self-starters -- applicants with a
                            strong
                            entrepreneurial spirit -- so proudly tell the story of your babysitting, lawn mowing, car detailing, tutoring, painting, or pet-sitting
                            business (or whatever YOUR business is).

                            <p class="p_modal">Aditya Uddhav Thackeray (born 13 June 1990) is an Indian Politician serving as Cabinet Minister of Tourism and Environment for the Government of Maharashtra. He is also an MLA of Maharashtra Legislative Assembly from Mumbai, Maharashtra. He is the son of Uddhav Thackeray, an Indian politician serving as the 19th and current Chief Minister of Maharashtra, leader of the Shiv Sena, and grandson of Balasaheb Thackeray.[1] He is the President of Yuva Sena, a youth wing of Shiv Sena. He is senior Maharashtra Cabinet minister. He is son of Chief Minister of Maharashtra Uddhav Thackeray. He was inducted as a cabinet minister in the state cabinet on 30 December 2019. <br><br>
                                Early life
                                Aditya was born to Rashmi Thackeray and Uddhav Thackeray in Bombay (now Mumbai). He has a younger brother called Tejas. He completed his schooling from Bombay Scottish School, Mahim, a Mumbai English medium school founded by Scottish missionaries. [2] Thackeray later obtained a BA History degree while studying at St. Xavier's College, Mumbai. He did his post-graduation from K C Law College, Mumbai where he earned his LLB degree.[3]
                                Work
                                His first book of poems, 'My Thoughts in White and Black', was published in 2007. The following year, he turned lyricist and released a private album Ummeed, for which he wrote all the eight songs.[4]
                                He was involved in or initiated a book burning agitation against inclusion of Rohinton Mistry's book 'Such a Long Journey', which was critical of his party's violent actions, in Mumbai University's reading list in 2010. Thackeray alleged that the book included insulting language against his family and Marathi's[5][6]
                                Political career
                                In October 2019, Thackeray contested the 2019 Maharashtra Legislative Assembly election from the World constituency in Mumbai and subsequently emerged victorious. In doing so, he became the first member of the Thackeray family to contest and win elections.[7] He became the Cabinet Minister for tourism, protocol and environment on 30 December 2019 in the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government.
                                Prior to getting officially elected, Thackeray played instrumental role in few projects during the Devendra Fadnavis-led government, prominently being a ban of single-use plastics in Maharashtra, [8] which was well-received by residents of the state.[9] He also played vital role in importing Humboldt penguins for the first time in India to be exhibited in Byculla Zoo. Importing of penguins from South Korea was panned by environmentalists and politicians considering the tropical climate of the city.[10][11] This earned him the nickname of “baby penguin” following reports of deaths of few penguins due to bacterial infections.[12][13] In July 2020, a man was arrested by the Mumbai Police for calling Thackeray 'Baby Penguin' on Twitter.[14]
                                Aditya Thackeray was also linked to various conspiracy theories on the death of Sushant Singh Rajput.[15] This was rejected by himself and his political faction citing the theories were created for political benefit by the opposition faction of the state.[16]

                            <p class="p_modal">Vidya Balan born 1 January 1979) is an Indian actress. Known for pioneering a change in the portrayal of
                                women in Hindi cinema with her roles in female-led films, she is the recipient of several awards, including a National Film Award and six Filmfare
                                Awards. She was awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India in 2014.

                                Vidya aspired to a career in film from a young age and had her first acting role in the 1995 sitcom Hum Paanch. While pursuing a master's degree in sociology from the
                                University of Mumbai, she made several unsuccessful attempts to start a career in film, and featured in television commercials and music videos. She made
                                her film debut by starring in the Bengali film Bhalo Theko and received praise for her first Hindi film, the drama Parineeta. This was followed by commercial
                                successes in Lage Raho Munna Bhai (2006) and Bhool Bhulaiyaa (2007), but her roles in the romantic comedies Heyy Babyy (2007) and Kismat
                                Konnection (2008) had negative reviews.

                                Vidya went on to establish herself by starring in five consecutive commercial successes, which also earned her critical and awards recognition. These were in the drama Paa
                                (2009), the black comedy Ishqiya (2010), the thrillers No One Killed Jessica and Kahaani (2012), and the biopic The Dirty Picture (2011). The last of these
                                won her the National Film Award for Best Actress. She followed this with a series of films that performed poorly at the box office. This changed when she
                                starred as a radio jockey in Tumhari Sulu (2017) and a scientist in Mission Mangal (2019). The latter ranks as her highest-grossing release.

                                Vidya also promotes humanitarian causes and supports the empowerment of women. She is a member of the Indian Central Board of Film Certification and hosts a radio show.
                                She initially drew criticism for her fluctuating weight and dress sense, but was later credited in the media for her unconventionality. Vidya is married to the
                                film producer Siddharth Roy Kapur.</p>

                            <p class="p_modal">Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani (born 19 April 1957) is an Indian billionaire businessman, and the chairman, managing director, and largest
                                shareholder of Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL), a Fortune Global 500 company and India's most valuable company by market value.[5] He is the richest
                                person in Asia with a net worth of US$ 83.1 billion and as of 14th March 2021, the 10th richest in the world.

                                Early life
                                Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani was born on 19 April 1957 in the British Crown colony of Aden (present-day Yemen) to Dhirubhai Ambani and Kokilaben Ambani. He has a younger
                                brother Anil Ambani and two sisters, Nina Bhadrashyam Kothari and Dipti Dattaraj Salgaonkar.

                                Ambani lived only briefly in Yemen, because his father decided to move back to India in 1958[8] to start a trading business that focused on spices and textiles. The latter was
                                originally named "Vimal" but later changed to "Only Vimal."[9] His family lived in a modest two-bedroom apartment in Bhuleshwar, Mumbai until the 1970s.
                                [10] The family's financial status slightly improved when they moved to India but Ambani still lived in a communal society, used public transportation, and
                                never received an allowance.[11] Dhirubhai later purchased a 14-floor apartment block called 'Sea Wind' in Colaba, where, until recently, Ambani and his
                                brother lived with their families on different floors.[12]

                                Education
                                Ambani attended the Hill Grange High School at Peddar Road, Mumbai, along with his brother and Anand Jain, who later became his close associate.[13] After his secondary
                                schooling, he studied at the St. Xavier's College, Mumbai.[14] He then received a BE degree in Chemical Engineering from the Institute of Chemical
                                Technology.[15][16]

                                Ambani later enrolled for an MBA at Stanford University, but withdrew in 1980 to help his father build Reliance, which at the time was still a small but fast-growing enterprise.
                                His father felt that real-life skills were harnessed through experiences and not by sitting in a classroom, so he called his son back to India
                                from Stanford to
                                take command of a yarn manufacturing project in his company.[11]


                                Ambani has been quoted as saying that he was influenced by his teachers William F. Sharpe and Man Mohan Sharma because they are "the kind of professors who made you
                                think out of the box."[18]

                                Career
                                In 1981 he started to help his father Dhirubhai Ambani run their family business, Reliance Industries Limited. By this time, it had already expanded so that it also dealt in refining
                                and petrochemicals. The business also included products and services in retail and telecommunications industries. Reliance Retail Ltd., another subsidiary,
                                is also the largest retailer in India.[19] Reliance's Jio has earned a top-five spot in the country's telecommunication services since its public launch on 5
                                September 2016.


                                As of 2016, Ambani was ranked 36 and has consistently held the title of India's richest person on Forbes magazine's list for the past ten years.[20] He is the
                                only Indian businessman on Forbes' list of the world's most powerful people.[21] As of October 2020, Mukesh Ambani was ranked by Forbes as the 6th-
                                wealthiest person in the world.[7] He surpassed Jack Ma, executive chairman of Alibaba Group, to become Asia's richest person with a net worth of $44.3
                                billion in July 2018. He is also the wealthiest person in the world outside North America and Europe.[22] As of 2015, Ambani ranked fifth among India's
                                philanthropists, according to China's Hurun Research Institute.[23] He was appointed as a Director of Bank of America and became the first non-American
                                to be on its board.[24]

                                Through Reliance, he also owns the Indian Premier League franchise Mumbai Indians and is the founder of Indian Super League, a football league in India.[25] In 2012, Forbes
                                named him one of the richest sports owners in the world.[26] He resides at the Antilia Building, one of the world's most expensive private residences with its
                                value reaching $1 billion.[27]

                                Timeline
                                1980s – 1990s
                                In 1980, the Indian government under Indira Gandhi opened PFY (polyester filament yarn) manufacturing to the private sector. Dhirubhai Ambani applied for a license to set up
                                a PFY manufacturing plant. Obtaining the license was a long-drawn-out process requiring a strong connection within the bureaucracy system because the
                                government, at the time, was restricting large-scale manufacturing, making the importation of yarn for the textiles impossible.[28] In spite of stiff competition
                                from Tatas, Birlas and 43 others, Dhirubhai was awarded the license, more commonly addressed as License Raj.[29] To help him build the PFY plant,
                                Dhirubhai pulled his eldest son out of Stanford, where he was studying for his MBA, to work with him in the company. Ambani did not return to his university
                                program, leading Reliance's backward integration, where companies own their suppliers to generate more revenue and improve efficiency, in 1981 from
                                textiles into polyester fibers and further into petrochemicals, which the yarns were made from.[5] After joining the company, he reported daily to Rasikbhai
                                Meswani, then executive director. The company was being built from scratch with the principle of everybody contributing to the business and not heavily
                                depend on selected individuals. Dhirubhai treated him as a business partner allowing him the freedom to contribute even with little experience.[30] This
                                principle came into play after Rasikbhai's death in 1985 along with Dhirubhai suffering a stroke in 1986 when all the responsibility shifted to Ambani and his
                                brother.[31] Mukesh Ambani set up Reliance Infocomm Limited (now Reliance Communications Limited), which was focused on information and
                                communications technology initiatives.[32] At the age of 24, Ambani was given charge of the construction of Patalganga petrochemical plant when the
                                company was heavily investing in oil refinery and petrochemicals.[33]

                                2000s – Present
                                On 6 July 2002, Mukesh's father died after suffering a second stroke,[34] which elevated tensions between the brothers as Dhirubhai had not left a will for the distribution of the
                                empire in 2004.[35] Their mother intervened to stop the feud, splitting the company into two, Ambani receiving control of Reliance Industries Limited and
                                Indian Petrochemicals Corporation Limited, which was later approved by the Bombay High Court in December 2005.[36][37]

                                Ambani directed and led the creation of the world's largest grassroots petroleum refinery at Jamnagar, India, which had the capacity to produce 660,000 barrels per day (33
                                million tonnes per year) in 2010, integrated with petrochemicals, power generation, port, and related infrastructure.[38] In December 2013 Ambani
                                announced, at the Progressive Punjab Summit in Mohali, the possibility of a "collaborative venture" with Bharti Airtel in setting up digital infrastructure for the
                                4G network in India.[39] On 18 June 2014, Mukesh Ambani, while addressing the 40th AGM of Reliance Industries, said he will invest Rs 1.8 trillion (short
                                scale) across businesses in the next three years and launch 4G broadband services in 2015.[40] In February 2016, Ambani-led Jio launched its own 4G
                                smartphone brand named LYF.[41] In June 2016, it was India's third-largest-selling mobile phone brand.[42] The release of the service
                                Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited, commonly known as Jio, in September 2016 was a success, and Reliance's shares increased.[43] During the 40th annual
                                general meeting of RIL, he announced bonus shares in the ratio of 1:1 which is the country's largest bonus issue in India, and announced the Jio Phone at
                                an effective price of ₹0. As of February 2018, Bloomberg's "Robin Hood Index" estimated that Ambani's personal wealth was enough to fund the
                                operations of the Indian federal government for 20 days.[45]

                                In February 2014, a First Information Report (FIR) alleging criminal offenses was filed against Mukesh Ambani for alleged irregularities in the pricing of natural gas from the KG
                                basin.[46] Arvind Kejriwal, who had a short stint as Delhi's chief minister and had ordered the FIR, has accused various political parties of being silent on the
                                gas price issue.[47] Kejriwal has asked both Rahul Gandhi and Narendra Modi to clear their stand on the gas pricing issue.[48][49] Kejriwal has alleged that
                                the Centre allowed the price of gas to be inflated to eight dollars a unit though Mukesh Ambani's company spends only one dollar to produce a unit, which
                                meant a loss of Rs. 540 billion to the country annually.[50][51]

                                He married Nita Ambani in 1985 and they have two sons; Akash Ambani and Anand Ambani, and a daughter, Isha.[66][4] They met after his father attended a dance
                                performance which Nita took part in and thought of the idea of arranging a marriage between the two.[67]

                                They live in Antilia, a private 27-storey building in Mumbai, which was valued at US$1 billion and was the most expensive private residence in the world at the time it was built.
                                The building requires a staff of 600 for maintenance, and it includes three helipads, a 160-car garage, private movie theater, swimming pool, and fitness center.[69]

                                In 2007, Ambani gifted his wife a $60 million Airbus A319 for her 44th birthday.[70] The Airbus, which has a capacity of 180 passengers, has been custom-fitted to include a
                                living room, bedroom, satellite television, WiFi, sky bar, Jacuzzi, and an office.[71]

                                Ambani was titled "The World's Richest Sports Team Owner" after his purchase of the IPL cricket team Mumbai Indians for $111.9 million in 2008.[72][73]

                                In an interview with Rajdeep Sardesai in March 2017, he said that his favourite food continued to be idli sambar and his favourite restaurant remains Mysore Cafe, a restaurant
                                in King's Circle (Mumbai) where he used to eat as a student at UDCT.[74] Mukesh Ambani is a strict vegetarian and teetotaler.[75] He is a very big fan of
                                Bollywood movies, watching three a week because he says "you need some amount of escapism in life."[35][30]

                                During the fiscal year ending 31 March 2012, he reportedly decided to forgo nearly ₹240 million from his annual pay as chief of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL). He elected to do
                                this even as RIL's total remuneration packages to its top management personnel increased during that fiscal year. Mukesh Ambani holds a 50.4% stake in
                                the company.[76] This move kept his salary capped at ₹150 million for the fourth year in a row.[77]

                                In early 2019, a court in Mumbai held his younger brother, Anil Ambani, in criminal contempt for non-payment of personally guaranteed debt Reliance Communications owed to
                                Swedish gearmaker Ericsson. Instead of jail time, the court gave Anil a month to come up with the funds. At the end of the month, Mukesh bailed out his
                                younger brother, paying the debt.[36]
